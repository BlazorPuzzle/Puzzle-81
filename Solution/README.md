# Puzzle #81: Dashboard Dilemma

Help Carl and Jeff create a dashboard where components can be added and removed at will

## The Challenge

In this puzzle, we explore the dynamic management of Blazor components loaded from a Razor Class Library. You'll need to implement a solution that allows components to be dynamically added, removed, and managed on a dashboard-style page.

### Setup

The solution consists of three projects:

- A Blazor Web App (`Puzzle81`)
- A Razor Class Library (`MyComponents`) containing various dashboard components:
  - KPI Summary
  - Sales Chart
  - Team Activity
- A Shared Library defining common interfaces

### Requirements

1. Create a dashboard page that can dynamically load components from the `MyComponents` library
2. Implement the ability to add and remove components at runtime
3. The solution should maintain component state when adding/removing components

### Tips

- Look into Blazor's `DynamicComponent` feature
- Consider using a component registry pattern
- Think about component state persistence

Join Carl and Jeff as they explore different approaches to solving this Blazor puzzle!

## The Solution

This solution demonstrates how to implement dynamic component management in a Blazor application, as requested by Carl and Jeff's customer. The implementation showcases a flexible dashboard system where components can be added, removed, and managed at runtime.

## Implementation Overview

### 1. Interface Definition
The `IDashboardComponent` interface in [`Shared/IDashboardComponent.cs`](./Shared/IDashboardComponent.cs) serves as the contract for all dashboard components:

```csharp
public interface IDashboardComponent
{
}
```

### 2. Component Library
The `MyComponents` library contains reusable dashboard components that implement the `IDashboardComponent` interface:

- [`KPISummary.razor`](./MyComponents/KPISummary.razor) - Business metrics overview
- [`SalesChart.razor`](./MyComponents/SalesChart.razor) - Sales performance visualization
- [`TeamActivity.razor`](./MyComponents/TeamActivity.razor) - Team collaboration metrics

Example of a component implementation:

```razor
@using MudBlazor
@implements IDashboardComponent

<MudPaper Class="pa-4">
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h5" Class="mb-4">Business Overview</MudText>
    <!-- Component content -->
</MudPaper>

@code {
    // Component logic
}
```

### 3. Dynamic Component Loading
In the main Blazor application (`Puzzle81`), components are loaded using Blazor's `DynamicComponent` feature:

```razor
<DynamicComponent Type="@componentType" Parameters="@parameters" />
```

### 4. Component Registration

The solution uses dependency injection to register dashboard components. This is done through an extension method in [`MyComponents/Startup.cs`](./MyComponents/Startup.cs):

```csharp
public static class ServiceCollectionExtensions
{
    public static IServiceCollection AddDashboardComponents(this IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddScoped<IDashboardComponent, SalesChart>();
        services.AddScoped<IDashboardComponent, KPISummary>();
        services.AddScoped<IDashboardComponent, TeamActivity>();
        
        return services;
    }
}
```

Components are registered as scoped services, allowing them to be injected and discovered at runtime. This approach provides several benefits:

- Leverages built-in dependency injection
- Maintains proper component lifecycle management
- Allows for easy addition of new components
- Provides type safety through the `IDashboardComponent` interface

## Key Features

1. **Component Discovery**: Components are automatically registered and discoverable
2. **Type Safety**: Strong typing through the `IDashboardComponent` interface
3. **Flexible Layout**: Components can be arranged in a grid or list layout

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `Puzzle81.sln` in Visual Studio
3. Run the application
4. Use the "Add Component" button to start adding dashboard components

This solution provides a flexible and maintainable approach to dynamic component management in Blazor, with components lazy loading, meeting all the requirements while maintaining good performance and user experience.
